### Pizza Menu
This site allows users to pick what pizza size they want and which toppings. It updates the total cost in real time as options are selected and deselected. Once the order button is placed, the total cost including sales tax is displayed.

### Calculator
This is a simple calculator with basic addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division functions. It can handle negative numbers and decimals.

### TicTacToe
This is the classic games of tic tac toe. A user plays against the computer, whose moves are selected randomly. Wins are celebrated with music.
